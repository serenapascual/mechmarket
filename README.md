# mechmarket
An iOS app for improving the user experience of trading on [r/mechmarket](https://reddit.com/r/mechmarket).

## About
When it comes to building a mechanical keyboard, there are endless options for customization. The mechmarket subreddit boasts over 170,000 members and allows users to buy, sell, and trade all things mechanical keyboard. These listings include switches, PCBs, keycaps, custom cables, and more.

Reddit isn't built for retail, so there are some pain points that come with using it in this way. For instance,
- Photos provided through external links are not viewable at a glance
- Search queries are challenging to filter (web and mobile), if not outright unfeasible (mobile)
- Post formatting can be unpredictable and make scanning for specific information tedious

This project is an attempt at what is essentially a Reddit client optimized for r/mechmarket.

I created the logo, a likeness of the popular [Holy Panda switch](https://switchandclick.com/2020/08/31/what-are-holy-panda-switches/), in Adobe Illustrator.

## To-do
A lot of work still needs to be done.

So far, authentication works and access tokens are securely stored in the user's device keychain. Next, I need to display the results retrieved from Reddit's endpoint.
